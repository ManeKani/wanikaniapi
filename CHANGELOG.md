# CHANGELOG

## v0.3.0 -- 2021-06-16

* Change `Object.LastModified` to a conditionally set pointer
    * This is technically a breaking change, but a very small one on a 0.x package with very few users, so releasing as a minor.

## v0.2.0 -- 2021-02-12

* Allow HTTP client to be configured with `ClientConfig.HTTPClient` (see documentation for details)

## v0.1.0 -- 2021-01-21

* Initial release
